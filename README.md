# The City Map

The City Map is the official adopted map of the city. It shows the location, dimension and grades of streets, parks, public places, and certain public easements. However, the City Map isn’t one comprehensive map; it’s a collection of many alteration maps for small areas of the City. This app brings all of the pieces of the City Map into one convenient place on the web.

## How we work

[NYC Planning Labs](https://planninglabs.nyc) takes on a single project at a time, working closely with our customers from concept to delivery in a matter of weeks.  We conduct regular maintenance between larger projects.  

Take a look at our [sprint planning board](https://waffle.io/NYCPlanning/labs-citymap) to get an idea of our current priorities for this project.

## Requirements

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
  - This installation was tested using Node v10.24.1
- [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Local development

- Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:NYCPlanning/labs-streets.git`
- Navigate to the repo: `cd labs-streets`
- Install Dependencies `yarn`
- Start the server `ember s`

## Connecting to local Layers API

By default, in development this app will acquire Layer Group information from the static file at `public/layer-groups/v1`.

To retrieve the latest layer group info by targetting a locally run or live Layers API, you can specify the `host` environment variable
within `config/environment.js`.

For example, if you are running a local Layers API at `localhost:3000`, then under the `environment === 'development'` condition in `config/envrinment.js`, add
```
 ENV.host = 'http://localhost:3000';
```

## Architecture

City Map is an [Ember.js](https://www.emberjs.com/) single page application (SPA). The frontend handles routing, web mapping, layout, and user interactions, and communicates with various APIs for content and data.

Several dependencies are split up into their own repositories under /lib, including labs-layers, labs-ember-search, and cartobox-promises-utility. These are starting points for possible addons. 

### Models, Layers, and Mutability
In this mapping iteration, we use models to manage individual layer and layer-group state. A layer group is a collection of layers, with a single visibility state. If a layer group's visibility is toggled off, that state is delegated to its related layers. These models allow for developers to reference a layer model from anywhere and manipulate its state, including layers' paint, layout, and filter states. These three properties are part of the MapboxGL Style Specification. 

Here are some examples of how to correctly override state:

#### Toggle visibility
```javascript
import { copy } from '@ember/object/internals';
import { set } from '@ember/object';

// ...
  changeVisibility() {
    const visible = this.get('visible');
    const visibility = (visible ? 'visible' : 'none');
    const layout = copy(this.get('layout'));

    if (layout) {
      set(layout, 'visibility', visibility);
      this.set('layout', layout);
    }
  }
// ...
```    

#### Change visibility
```javascript
import { copy } from '@ember/object/internals';
import { set } from '@ember/object';

// ...
  changeVisibility() {
    const visible = this.get('visible');
    const visibility = (visible ? 'visible' : 'none');
    const layout = copy(this.get('layout'));

    if (layout) {
      set(layout, 'visibility', visibility);
      this.set('layout', layout);
    }
  }
// ...
```    

#### Change paint
Paint must be changed with a full replacement of the object.
```javascript
const record = $E.store.peekRecord('layer', 'citymap-amendments-fill')
record.set('paint', { 'fill-color':'pink' });
```

#### Change filtering
For now, we need to use a helper method for this because updates aren't being triggered correctly yet.

```javascript
layerModelInstance.setFilter(['all', ['>=', 'effective', 100]]);
```

#### Map Styling

To style the map in development, we use [Maputnik Dev Server](https://github.com/NYCPlanning/labs-maputnik-dev-server). Check the `README` of maputnik-dev-server for the commands necessary to style the current map.

#### Layer-Groups

{TODO: explain how Layer Groups work}

## Backend services

Carto is the primary backend resource, which provides a PostGIS database, Map Tiler, and JSON/GeoJSON data API. All of the data represented in the app starts out as a PostGIS table in Carto.

- **Carto Maps API** - Spatial data used in the map are served as vector tiles from the Carto Maps API. Vector tiles are defined by a SQL query, and may include several named internal layers. Vector Tiles are defined in config files in app/sources, and the frontend converts each of these into a call to the Maps API, which produces a vector tile template that can be added to Mapbox GL as a 'source'.
- **Carto SQL API** - The SQL API is used to retrieve record-specific data, such as tax lot details when a user navigates to a specific lot. It is also used to cross-reference a selected lot on-the-fly with various other layers to find intersections.
- **Search** - {TODO: description of this service}

## Testing and checks

- **ESLint** - We use ESLint with Airbnb's rules for JavaScript projects
  - Add an ESLint plugin to your text editor to highlight broken rules while you code
  - You can also run `eslint` at the command line with the `--fix` flag to automatically fix some errors.

- **Testing**
  - run `ember test --serve`
  - Before creating a Pull Request, make sure your branch is updated with the latest `develop` and passes all tests

## Deployment

The App is deployed to our VPS using Dokku, you need only do a `git push` of the master branch to the `dokku` remote.

- To create a new remote named `dokku`: `git remote add dokku dokku@{domain}:city-map`
- To Deploy: `git push dokku master`
- To deploy a branch other than master, alias it to master: `git push dokku {branchname}:master`

## Uploading New Files to Digital Ocean Spaces

1. Ask the client to send you the new files they want uploaded to the app. This can be over Slack, Box, Dropbox, etc. 
2. Download the new files in a folder on your machine. 

3. Before uploading these files to Spaces,  you need to install s3cmd on your machine. You can download the file here: https://s3tools.org/download 
4. Once you have s3cmd downloaded, navigate (in your terminal) to the s3cmd folder you just downloaded
5. Run the command 	$ sudo python setup.py install
6. Then run 		$ s3cmd --configure

	Fill in the new config options:

Access Key: access key (this will be given to you by another team member)
Secret Key: secret key (this will be given to you by another team member)
Default Region [US]: [press enter]
S3 Endpoint: nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
DNS-style bucket+hostname: %(bucket)s.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
Encryption password: [press enter]
Path to GPG program: [press enter]
Use HTTPS protocol [Yes/No]: Yes
HTTP Proxy server name: [press enter]
Test access with supplied credentials? [Y/n] y

//If you see this error about GPG program, type in "n" for Retry configuration 

ERROR: Test failed: GPG program not found
Retry configuration? [Y/n] n

Save settings? [y/N] y
Configuration saved to '/Users/YourFile/.s3cfg'

7. After setting up the config, navigate to the directory with the files you downloaded from the client, and run this command in the terminal: 

	$  s3cmd --acl-public put ./* s3://nycdcp-dcm-alteration-maps --recursive

	// “--acl-public” allows anyone to view the file online
	// “ ./* ” signifies a specific path to follow to locate the folder
	// “s3://nycdcp-dcm-alteration-maps” is the folder on Spaces where you are adding the new files
	// "--recursive" is necessary to upload a directory

8. Make sure to have another team member add you to the Digital Ocean account. You will receive an email when you have been added. Create a new account from this email, and now you are able to view the files that have been uploaded to the Spaces folder.
